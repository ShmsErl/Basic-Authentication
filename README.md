# Spring Workshop
*****************

## The aim of this study :
The HTTP protocol provides a mechanism called HTTP Authentication that helps authenticate the user for scenarios where access to web pages or APIs is to be restricted.

The web server checks the Authorisation: HTTP Header when a request is received from a client to a restricted resource. If the incoming request does not contain the Authorisation: header, i.e. the information required to authenticate the client, or if it is invalid, it sends the client a 401 Unauthorised status code in response, along with the type of authentication it supports with the WWW-Authenticate: header. After this point, the client repeats its request to the server either by asking the user or by renewing the authentication information with the information it has.
